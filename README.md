I make open software at @masteclab, a site for university students where they can find code for their projects

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Mastec Lab

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects for educational purposes

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with developing and maintaining educational resources

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about open hardware, educational projects, coding for beginners
