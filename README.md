## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I like to make things happen. I make open hardware at @masteclab, a site for university students where they can find code for their projects.

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Mastec Lab

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 

ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Open source projects for educational purposes

ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Developing and maintaining educational resources

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about: Open hardware, educational projects, coding for beginners

âš¡ **Fun fact:** I like robots
