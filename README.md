## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I make open software at @masteclab, a site for university students where they can find code for their projects

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Mastec Lab

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 

ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects for educational purposes

ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with developing and maintaining educational resources

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about open hardware, educational projects, coding for beginners

âš¡ **Fun fact:** I like robots
